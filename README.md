# AlphaBruteforce
Multiplies matricies of the alphabet to bruteforce combinations

Essentially what is going on here is that the alphabet is separated into groups of 3.
The sets are then multiplied against all other sets combining with every combination or pairs. 
Each section can be adjusted. 

More pairs, will require more push statements to 'e'

the sets can be chosen randomly, and adjusted for the amount of sets repeated.

I wrote a script that sets up the sets of 3, which could be adjusted to meet any number, but removed it due to it taking away from the important parts.
However, this can also be readded.
